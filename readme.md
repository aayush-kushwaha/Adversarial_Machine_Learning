# 📘 Adversarial Machine Learning: FGSM & PGD Attacks on CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates how **adversarial attacks** can drastically degrade the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the **CIFAR-10** dataset.
Two major white-box attacks are implemented:

* **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)**
* **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)**

The project evaluates model robustness across different perturbation strengths, computes Attack Success Rates (ASR), and visualizes adversarial examples vs. clean images.

## 🧠 1. Overview

This project:

* Trains a custom **SimpleCNN** on CIFAR-10
* Achieves **83.92% clean test accuracy**
* Generates adversarial examples using FGSM and PGD
* Computes **Adversarial Accuracy** and **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**
* Evaluates attacks across multiple ε values and PGD iteration counts
* Includes visualizations such as:
  * Clean vs. FGSM vs. PGD
  * 10-image grids
  * Perturbation heatmaps
  * 3-row combined layouts

---

## 📦 2. Dataset

**CIFAR-10** contains:

* 60,000 images
* 32×32 RGB
* 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)

Training transformations:

* Random crop
* Random horizontal flip
* Standard CIFAR normalization

---

## 🏗️ 3. Model Architecture

The **SimpleCNN** consists of:

* Three convolution blocks: `Conv → ReLU → MaxPool`
* Flatten layer
* Two fully connected layers

This lightweight architecture keeps training fast while still being expressive enough for adversarial research.

---

## 🎯 4. Training Results

The model was trained for **40 epochs** with SGD + Momentum + Weight Decay.

### Final Clean Test Accuracy:
```
83.92%
```

This is the baseline accuracy before applying FGSM and PGD attacks.

---

## ⚡ 5. FGSM Attack

FGSM perturbs the input using:
```
x_adv = x + ε * sign(∇x Loss)
```

### FGSM Result (ε = 0.05):
```
Clean accuracy: 83.91%
Adversarial accuracy: 33.17%
ASR: 66.83%
```

### Effect of Epsilon (ε):

| ε    | Adv Accuracy | ASR    |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 0.00 | 83.89%       | 16.11% |
| 0.01 | 72.09%       | 27.91% |
| 0.03 | 49.00%       | 51.00% |
| 0.05 | 33.17%       | 66.83% |
| 0.10 | 12.14%       | 87.86% |

**Observation:**
Increasing ε rapidly reduces model accuracy and increases the attack success rate.

---

## 🔥 6. PGD Attack

PGD applies iterative FGSM-like steps with projection back into the ε-ball.

### PGD Result (ε = 0.05, 10 steps):
```
Adversarial accuracy: 18.75%
ASR: 81.25%
```

### Effect of PGD Steps (ε = 0.05):

| Steps | Adv Accuracy | ASR    |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 5     | 23.22%       | 76.78% |
| 10    | 18.75%       | 81.25% |
| 20    | 17.70%       | 82.30% |
| 40    | 17.45%       | 82.55% |

**Observation:**
More steps produce stronger attacks, with diminishing returns after ~20 iterations.

## 🖼️ 7. Visualizations

The notebook includes:

* **Clean vs FGSM vs PGD** comparisons
* **10-image side-by-side grids**
* **Perturbation heatmaps**
* **3-row combined layouts** (Clean → FGSM → PGD)

**Key Insight:**
Adversarial images look almost identical to clean images, yet predictions change significantly — showing how vulnerable CNNs can be.

## 🏁 11. Summary

This project demonstrates:

* CNNs achieve strong performance on clean CIFAR-10 images
* FGSM and PGD perturbations drastically reduce accuracy even with minimal noise
* PGD outperforms FGSM at the same epsilon
* Larger ε or more PGD steps increase attack success
* Adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in deep learning systems
